# requirements/specification
-------------------------------------------------
aka: what the software should be capable of

# general
- portability between win and linux
- minimum memory footprint on host machine
- how can the code be protected during runtime
- how can the owner of the host machine be shut out???

# crypto-remailer
- core feature
- receives a mail decrypts it, and forwards it encrypted to a list of recipients
- all recipients are unknown to each other (configurable? if "unknwon" is deactivated, the list of recipients will be included in the paranoia_mail header)
- sender may be obscured too (remove all ident info from header!)
- adds a header to the mail:
  - lists of recipients (if configured)
  - sender (if configured?)
  - sender successfully authenticated
- configurable: sender authentication (by pgp signing):
  - strict check (unauthenticated mails will be bounced)
  - light check (authentication will be noted in paranoia_mail header)
  - no check
- must be usable with the same profile (see below) from different machines: mails are deleted on server upon remailing; configuration mus be downloadable from 

# configuration management
- all persistence must be done encrypted
- there may be different profiles, each consisting of
  - a list of recipients with their pgp keys
  - configuration items
  - pgp key pair of the list
  - mailadress of the list
- list configuration will be saved on mail server encrypted (special mail); and will be downloaded at startup??? yes!

# gui
- simple, portable, configurable...
